How exciting it is to learn new skills and concept from those who have got their hands dirty. It makes learning so exciting.
On the other hand if its the other way it becomes a burden, which ought not to be.
We owe the society the obligation to mentor and bring others to our level that is a lasting legacy. By so doing we reproduce ourselves in others. How exciting it would be for everyone.

Hello, I like Android. Anything mobile turns me on. I like to learn new things and explore the mobile universe.
